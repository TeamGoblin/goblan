		<h3>Events</h3>
		<h4 class="red">CS Tournament</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Counter-Strike 1.6</li>
				<li>90 second rounds, 15 rounds per half, 15s freezetime, start with $800</li>
				<li>1 Two minute timeout available per map per team</li>
				<li>Overtime rules: 3 rounds per half, start with $7500</li>
				<li>Sides will be selected by pre-game knife round, winner picks side</li>
				<h5>Day 1 (Minimum 4 games, Maximum 6) - Determine Seeding</h5>
				<li>Best of 3 maps (games) for each match</li>
				<li>Maps decided by lurppis style picking (alternate on removing maps until there are three maps left, at which point each team picks their own map. The thing about this system is, that the last map remaining, is actually played first, and the loser's map always follows after)</li>
				<li>Maps: dust2, nuke, inferno, cpl_mill or tuscan, train, cbble, lite, strike or mirage</li>
				<li>Using “semi-final” lurppis tournament format (1 v 2; 3 v 4 - winners play each other, losers play each other for 3rd) so only 2 rounds to day 1.  Eliminates possible ties from round-robin style (like if 3 teams go 2-1 and 1 team goes 0-3) and sets up seeding for day 2.</li>

				<h5>Day 2 (Minimum 2 games, Maximum 5)</h5>
				<li>Best of 1 map, double elimination tournament</li>
				<li>Maps decided by lurppis style picking (alternate on removing maps until there is only one map left)</li>
